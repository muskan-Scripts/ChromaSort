# ChromaSort - Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

**ChromaSort** is an interactive React.js application designed to visualize various sorting algorithms with dynamic animations and user controls. It aims to make learning sorting algorithms engaging and intuitive by providing a visually appealing and educational experience.

## Features
- **Dynamic Animations:** Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms with customizable speed and array size.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Supports multiple sorting algorithms, including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **User Controls:** Easily adjust array size, sorting speed, and generate new arrays for experimentation.
- **Intuitive UI/UX:** A clean and responsive design that enhances user interaction and learning.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Styling:** CSS animations for smooth transitions and visual effects
- **State Management:** React hooks for efficient state handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muskan-Scripts/ChromaSort.git
   cd ChromaSort
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the development server:
   npm start
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start - Runs the app in the development mode. The page will reload if you make edits.
npm run build - Builds the app for production, creating an optimized build folder.

### How It Works

Select a sorting algorithm from the menu.
Adjust the array size and sorting speed using the provided controls.
Click "Generate Array" to create a new unsorted array.
Press "Start Sorting" to visualize the algorithm in action.

### Folder Structure
src/components: Contains reusable React components for the application.
src/styles: CSS files for animations and styling.
src/utils: Helper functions and algorithms for sorting logic.

### Future Enhancements
Add support for additional algorithms like Heap Sort and Radix Sort.
Introduce detailed step-by-step explanations for each algorithm.
Provide a dark mode theme for enhanced user accessibility.
